# Proposal - Vancouver Crime Watch

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- **Our Role**: Data Science Consultants
- **Target Audience**: Prospective renters and housing occupants in Vancouver

With the cost of housing skyrocketing across different regions and neighborhoods in Vancouver, potential residents are in dire need of reliable ways to verify the safety levels and crime situations associated with areas they are considering before signing a lease or procuring that property. Renting is a major financial commitment, and choosing the wrong neighborhood could significantly affect both safety and quality of life.

To help prospects make informed decisions, we are presenting **The Vancouver Crime Watch Dashboard Application (VCW App)**. **VCW App** will provide insights into the crime severity levels across neighborhoods, with granularity down to specific areas or blocks. Users will be able to explore crime patterns, filter by crime type or location, and compare different neighborhoods.

By providing clear visual findings, our app empowers users to make informed rental decisions, assess safety risks, and take appropriate precautionary measures or avoid high-risk areas altogether.

## Section 2: Description of the Data
Describe the dataset you finalized in Step 1.

Stats: Number of rows/columns.
Relevance: How variables potentially link to the problem.

## Section 3: Research Questions & Usage Scenarios
Detail how the audience will interact with the app.

Persona: Brief description of a user.
Usage Scenario create a narrative describing user needs and context.
User Stories / JTBD: Provide at least 3 User Stories or Job Stories that outline specific tasks the user needs to perform.

## Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Demonstrate that your data can actually support your user stories.

Select one of your User Stories/JTBD from Section 3.
Create a Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder (e.g., notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb).
Create 1-2 static visualizations or summary tables that directly address the user's task.
In your proposal document (this section), briefly explain what the visualization shows and how comparing these values specifically supports the user's decision-making.
(Include the relevant plots or a link to the notebook in this section).


## Section 5: App Sketch & Description
Sketch: A visual mockup showing layout and components (hand-drawn or software-generated). Save it as img/sketch.png and embed it in your proposal markdown file (e.g., ![Sketch](../img/sketch.png)).
Description: High-level explanation of interface components and interactions (landing page, filters, charts).
