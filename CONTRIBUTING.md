# Contributing to the Vancouver Neighbourhood Safety Dashboard project

This file outlines how to propose changes to the Vancouver Neighbourhood Safety Dashboard project. 

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  Correct: you edit a docstring or comment in a `.py` file below `src/` directory.
*  Incorrect: you edit a generated documentation file, such as a `.html` under `docs/_build/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and report the issue with enough detail so we can provide help faster.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  New code should follow PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
